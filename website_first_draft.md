Project requirements:

- The website should have these sections/pages:
  - Home (banner + carousel + about + highlights)
  - About Us
  - Services / Events
  - Gallery
  - Contact (with form)
- Use a consistent header (Navbar) and footer across all pages.
- Make it visually clean and inspired by The Nehru Centre’s structure, spacing, and color tone.

Technical requirements:

- Use Tailwind for styling (mobile-first responsive design).
- Implement a simple auto-sliding carousel with smooth transitions.
- Use semantic HTML structure for SEO.
- Prepare the site for **Firebase Hosting** (include firebase.json and deployment instructions).
- Add a simple “Contact Us” form that prints the data to console for now (later can connect to Firebase).
- Optimize all images for web use (use sample placeholders or direct links in `public/images`).

Output:

- Complete React project structure with all files.
- Include clear comments explaining where to replace content and how to deploy on Firebase.
- Provide sample text placeholders for each section.
